This project aimed to develop a user-friendly tool to quickly annotate drivers’ gaze data, enhancing road safety research by identifying how distractions contribute to accidents.

## Background:

Gaze tracking technology has received a lot of attention in recent years due to its potential applications in various fields, including driver safety, human-computer interaction, and clinical diagnostics. Our research builds upon existing studies such as the EU-funded UDRIVE project [1], which examined gaze direction in drivers, and the study by Jansen et al. [2], which explains the complexities associated with human annotation of gaze direction in naturalistic driving studies.

## Aim and Research Questions:

The primary aim of our research is to investigate whether the reliability of determining gaze direction can be enhanced through the development of a structured method for obtaining images of drivers, thereby training a predictive model for the respective driver, which will subsequently annotate images automatically. Additionally, our goal is to develop an intuitive, user-friendly application that enables traffic researchers to annotate images automatically.

## Research Design:

We adopt a deductive approach, collecting data by filming in a stationary car, then training models in Google Colab and Lightning AI to find the most effective one.

## Scientific and Societal Relevance:

Our research is significant for advancing gaze tracking technology and improving driver safety by providing a tool that simplifies annotation. Additionally, our research addresses ethical considerations surrounding the use of gaze tracking technology, ensuring that it is implemented responsibly and ethically. Ethical Considerations and Data Collection Focusing on ethical considerations like privacy and data security, our project adopts data minimization, informed consent, and privacy by design principles for responsible technology use. Regarding data collection, we do not maintain a central database; researchers collect their own datasets and retain full control over their data, further reinforcing our commitment to data ownership and privacy. To ensure consent is safeguarded, we require informed consent from all participants. Data security will be achieved by implementing encryption for data in transit. Overall, we will comply with the requirements set forth by the EU AI Act, by focusing on risk assessment, being transparent, and using AI ethically to make sure our project upholds the highest standards of responsibility and accountability. Regarding privacy and ethical considerations, we won’t do anything that isn’t already happening in other applications, like
distraction detection systems and sleep warning systems.

In summary, our research project seeks to develop innovative methodologies for accurately tracking and analyzing drivers’ gaze direction, ultimately contributing to enhanced road safety. We believe that the findings of this study will not only advance scientific knowledge but also have positivetangible benefits for society.
